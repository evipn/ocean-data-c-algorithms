# C Algorithms and Data Structures

A C project implementing and testing basic sorting algorithms and tree structures. Developed as part of a data structures course.

## Files

- `AVL.c` – AVL tree implementation
- `HeapSort.c` – Heap Sort algorithm
- `InsertionSort_BIS.c` – Insertion Sort (basic)
- `InsertionSort_Search.c` – Insertion Sort with search
- `QuickSort.c` – Quick Sort implementation

## How to Run

Compile and run any file using:

```bash
gcc QuickSort.c -o quicksort
./quicksort

## My Role
I implemented all sorting algorithms and data structures, and tested them for speed and correctness.
